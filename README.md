# secure-auth with expressjs
A secured auth API mainly for developers by me "Ibrahim Habib".
MVC Pattern Project,
The API is mainly made up of 4 Routes (Register, Login, Dashboard, Logout),
Input Validations with express validator module,
Authentication with JWT,
MongoDB,
Use POSTMAN/THUNDER CLIENT to test the project,
